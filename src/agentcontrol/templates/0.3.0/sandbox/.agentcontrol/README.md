# Sandbox Capsule

This capsule ships a minimal-but-complete AgentControl workspace focused on experimentation.

- `.agentcontrol/config/docs.bridge.yaml` maps managed regions into the live docs tree.
- `.agentcontrol/config/commands.sh` proxies standard pipelines to the host SDK.
- `docs/` contains lightweight architecture, ADR, and RFC entry points monitored by the bridge.

Use the sandbox CLI commands to create and clean up instances.
