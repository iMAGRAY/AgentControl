# RFC-0001 — Agent Cycle Interface

**Status:** draft (date: 2025-09-29)
**Authors:** gpt-5-codex

## Summary
Define the entrypoint for make agent-cycle and the mirror REST API consumed by external agents.

## Motivation
Hybrid-H pipelines require a unified workflow that orchestrates sync, verification, and reporting.

## Proposal
make agent-cycle runs the generator, validates manifest.yaml, and publishes a report. Offer the same lifecycle through POST /agent-cycle.

**Related Systems:** control-plane, doc-sync
